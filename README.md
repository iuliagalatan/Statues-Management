# Statues-Management
My biggest OOP project until now. Coded in C++, GUI - made with Qt, different types of repositories( memory/file/cvs/html/sql..  ) which can be combined for the 2 modes of the application.

The application manages the statues of a city.

A statue is described as having : PowerWordName, Material, Corporeal Form, Age.

There are 2 modes: Mode A. Statues can be modified (deleted, filtered, added, updated), added to mylist.
                   Mode B. Client Mode. Statues can only be viewed, mylist-opened with an external window.
